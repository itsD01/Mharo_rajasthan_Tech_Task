Rana Pratap Singh, (born 1545?, Mewar [India]—died January 19, 1597, Mewar), Hindu maharaja (1572–97) of the Rajput
 confederacy of Mewar, now in northwestern India and eastern Pakistan. He successfully resisted efforts 
 of the Mughal emperor Akbar to conquer his area and is honoured as a hero in Rajasthan.
 Rana Pratap Singh, (born 1545?, Mewar [India]—died January 19, 1597, Mewar), Hindu maharaja (1572–97) of the Rajput 
 confederacy of Mewar, now in northwestern India and eastern Pakistan. He successfully resisted efforts of the Mughal
  emperor Akbar to conquer his area and is honoured as a hero in Rajasthan.

The son and successor of the weak Rana Udai Singh, Rana Pratap sought to avenge the 1567 pillage of his capital, Chitor,
 and subsequent raids by Akbar; this was in notable contrast to his fellow Hindu princes, who had submitted to the Mughals. 
 Rana Pratap reorganized the government, improved the forts, and directed his subjects to take refuge in the mountain 
 country when attacked by Mughals. After insulting one of Akbar’s emissaries and refusing an alliance, he was defeated 
 in June 1576 by Mughal forces at Haldighat and fled to the hills. Despite the loss of many of his strongholds,
  he continued to harass the Mughals and urged noncooperation and passive resistance to Akbar’s tax collectors. 
  In the meantime, Mewar declined to a wasteland.
<br>
In 1584 Rana Pratap again rebuffed emissaries of Akbar, who was preoccupied in the Punjab. Accordingly, 
Rana Pratap was able to recover most of his strongholds and died a hero to his people. He was succeeded by his son 
Amar Singh, who submitted in 1614 to Emperor Jahāngīr, son of Akbar.

  <b><h3>Udai Singh II </b></h3>
  <img src="C:\Users\divya\Downloads\Rana-udai-singh-ii.jpg" alt="Mharo Rajasthan" width="250px" class="centre" style="width:15%;">
  <br>
  Udai Singh II (August 4, 1522 – February 28, 1572) was the <b>Maharana of Mewar</b> and the <b>founder 
  of the city of <i>Udaipur</i></b> in the 
  present day Rajasthan state of India. He was the 53rd ruler of the Mewar Dynasty. He was the fourth son of Maharana Sangram 
  Singh (Rana Sanga) and Rani Karnavati, a princess of Bundi.
  Udai Singh was born in Chittor. In August, 1522. after the death of his father, Maharana Sangram Singh, he was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Maharana Ratan Singh. 
  Ratan Singh was assassinated in 1531. He was succeeded by his brother Maharana Vikramaditya Singh. During his reign, when the Turkic Sultan of Gujarat Bahadur Shah sacked C
  hittor in 1534, Udai Singh was sent to Bundi for safety. In 1537, Banbir killed Vikramaditya and usurped the throne. He tried to kill Udai Singh also, but Udai's nurse 
  Panna Dhai sacrificed her own son to save him from his uncle Banbir and took him to Kumbhalgarh. She did not ask for anything in return either. She started living in Bundi
   and did not allow Udai Singh to come and meet her. He lived in secret in Kumbhalgarh for two years, disguised as a nephew of the governor Asha Shah Depura(Maheshwari).
<br>
<br>
In 1540, he was crowned in Kumbhalgarh by the nobles of Mewar. His eldest son Maharana Pratap from his first wife, Maharani 
Jaivantabai Songara[daughter of Akhey Raj Songara of Jalore], was born in the same year. He had twenty wives and twenty-five sons.
 His second wife, Sajjabai Solankini gave birth to his son Shakti, Sagar Singh and Vikram Dev. Dheerbai Bhattiyani was his favourite 
 wife and was the mother of his son Jagmal Singh and daughters Chand kanwar and Maan Kanwar. His fourth wife was Rani Veerbai Jhaala 
 daughter of Rana Jaith Singh of Kherwa.
<br>
<br>
In 1562, he gave refuge to Baz Bahadur of Malwa. Using this as a pretext, Akbar attacked Mewar in October,1567. On October 23, 
1567 Akbar formed his camp near Udaipur. According to Kaviraj Shyamaldas, Udai Singh called a council of war. The nobles advised
 him to take refuge along with the princes in the hills, leaving a garrison at Chittor. Udai Singh retired to Gogunda 
 (which later became his temporary capital) leaving Chittor in the hands of his loyal chieftains Jaimal and Patta. 
 Akbar captured Chittor after a long siege on February 25, 1568. He later shifted his capital to Udaipur. He died in 1572
  in Gogunda. Before his death, he nominated his fourth son Jagmal as his successor under the influence of his favourite
   queen and Jagmal's mother Rani Bhattiyani. But after his death, the nobles of Mewar prevented Jagmal from succeeding 
   and placed Maharana Pratap Singh on the throne on March 1, 1572.
